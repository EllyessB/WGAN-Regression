## Exploring regression with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks

Code produced for the paper "Exploring regression with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks" by Ellyess Benmoufok, supervised by: Christopher Pain, Alexandra Porter and Toby Phillips.

## Information
The code in this folder was developed later into the project and is covered in the "Alternative Method" section of the report. It is essentially the same model with removal of the "Sliding Window" data preprocessing used in the main code. For future development this code will be the focus.

## Performance
The model included here requires thorough adjustments to the hyperparameters and structure for good performance.
